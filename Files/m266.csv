136918, u3990 ," Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible.

136928, u3990 ," Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
136929, u3993 ," ... Straight out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136930, u3990 ," Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,

136933, u3993 ," I see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136934, u3990 ," However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
136935, u3993 ," Yes. I think so, too."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136936, u3990 ," It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136937, u3990 ," But not for long...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
136938, u3993 ," You were wrong, it did hurt."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136939, u3990 ," Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
136940, u3993 ," I understand. I've seen it done before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,

136942, u4012 ," I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136943, u3990 ," It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4012 ,m266,,
136944, u4012 ," No more, Robert... No more needles..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4012 ,m266,,
136945, u4012 ," In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136946, u3990 ," And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4012 ,m266,,
136947, u4012 ," We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136948, u3990 ," Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136949, u3990 ," That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4012 ,m266,,
136950, u4012 ," ... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4012 ,m266,,
136951, u4012 ," Of course! By kid-lawyers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136952, u3990 ," To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4012 ,m266,,
136953, u4012 ," I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136954, u3990 ," I think we'd better go look for him.  David!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,

136956, u3990 ," You really care for him, don't you, Eve?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136957, u3998 ," We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136958, u3998 ," I wish he were here...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136959, u3990 ," I don't think so, he should be along soon..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136960, u3998 ," ... Do you think we should look for him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136961, u3998 ," Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136962, u3990 ," ... He walked off...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,

136966, u3990 ," No, Eve... I'm sorry."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136967, u3998 ," Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136968, u3990 ," At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136969, u3998 ," He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136970, u3990 ," How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136971, u3998 ," Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136972, u3990 ," Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136973, u3998 ," Stay here? Is that necessary?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136974, u3990 ," A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
136975, u3998 ," I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136976, u3990 ," Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
136977, u4000 ," Certainly, glad to be of help."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136978, u3990 ," Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
136979, u4000 ," Of course, Doctor, I understand."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136980, u3990 ," I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
136981, u4000 ," Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136982, u3990 ," Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
136983, u4000 ," Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3990 ,m266,,
136984, u3990 ," I have no idea...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
136985, u4000 ," ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4011 ,m266,,
136986, u4011 ," Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3991 ,m266,,
136987, u3991 ," Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4011 ,m266,,
136988, u4011 ," And what do the boys around Intelligence think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3991 ,m266,,
136989, u3991 ," I don't think that's entirely true, Grover."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4011 ,m266,,
136990, u4011 ," Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3991 ,m266,,
136991, u3991 ," Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4011 ,m266,,
136992, u4011 ," Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3992 ,m266,,
136993, u3992 ," Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,

136995, u3992 ," Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
136996, u3993 ," A Black man gave me the message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3992 ,m266,,
136997, u3992 ," Yes, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
136998, u3993 ," Oh. I have a message for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3992 ,m266,,

137002, u4009 ," Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
137003, u3993 ," Yes. I would like to be on that show.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4009 ,m266,,

137018, u3998 ," Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3998 ,m266,,
137019, u3998 ," ... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,

And neither of us wants that, do you agree?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,

137203, u4013 ," Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation...

But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people...

A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,

137384, u3993 ," Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3997 ,m266,,
137385, u3997 ," Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
137386, u3993 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3997 ,m266,,

137390, u3993 ," Which view?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3997 ,m266,,
137391, u3997 ," Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
137392, u3993 ," No. I don't object.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3997 ,m266,,

137396, u3993 ," Yes. That is surprising.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3997 ,m266,,

137398, u3993 ," You're welcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3997 ,m266,,

137408, u4000 ," Come now, Mr. Chance."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
137409, u3993 ," No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
137410, u4000 ," Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
137411, u3993 ," I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,

137420, u3993 ," No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4000 ,m266,,
137421, u4000 ," Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,

137436, u4000 ," Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3993 ,m266,,
