142263, u4166 ," Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142264, u4161 ," What good does that do -- it's the old will?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142265, u4166 ," Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142266, u4161 ," What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142267, u4166 ," Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142268, u4161 ," Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,

142271, u4166 ," You got something on the Coke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142272, u4161 ," I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142273, u4161 ," Because it hasn't all been erased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142274, u4166 ," Why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142275, u4161 ," It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142276, u4166 ," So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142277, u4161 ," I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142278, u4161 ," No -- but I got something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142279, u4166 ," You got something on the coke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,

142284, u4166 ," I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142285, u4161 ," So -- where do we start?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142286, u4166 ," We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4161 ,m278,,
142287, u4161 ," I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,

142289, u4161 ," Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.

142292, u4162 ," Did I say it was a natural death?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4177 ,m278,,
142293, u4177 ," Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142294, u4162 ," For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4177 ,m278,,
142295, u4177 ," An inquiry into what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,

142298, u4162 ," Then you can go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4179 ,m278,,

142303, u4162 ," What about the will?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4179 ,m278,,
142304, u4179 ," Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142305, u4162 ," So she knew about his heart?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4179 ,m278,,
142306, u4179 ," He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142307, u4162 ," What did he say about Miss Lawson?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4179 ,m278,,
142308, u4179 ," Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142309, u4162 ," Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142310, u4171 ," It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142311, u4162 ," What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142312, u4171 ," It would be an added stress to his heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142313, u4162 ," -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142314, u4171 ," Increase his heart rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,

142317, u4162 ," Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142318, u4171 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142319, u4162 ," Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142320, u4171 ," We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142321, u4162 ," Then how did it get into his body?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142322, u4171 ," I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142323, u4162 ," So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142324, u4171 ," We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,

142327, u4162 ," Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,

142329, u4162 ," What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142330, u4171 ," A massive cardiac arrest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142331, u4162 ," Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,

142334, u4162 ," Any prints on the nasal spray?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142335, u4171 ," We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142336, u4162 ," What can we prove?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142337, u4171 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142338, u4162 ," What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142339, u4162 ," But there's more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142340, u4171 ," That's what my report will read.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142341, u4162 ," The official cause?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142342, u4171 ," The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142343, u4162 ," What'd he die of?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142344, u4171 ," Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142345, u4171 ," Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142346, u4162 ," Cause?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4171 ,m278,,
142347, u4171 ," About three hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142348, u4162 ," Your witness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4167 ,m278,,

142350, u4162 ," Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,

142352, u4167 ," Sex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142353, u4162 ," What was the nature of the argument?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4167 ,m278,,
142354, u4167 ," Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142355, u4162 ," Did they argue the day before he died?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4167 ,m278,,
142356, u4167 ," You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142357, u4162 ," What did they argue about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4167 ,m278,,
142358, u4167 ," Like cats and dogs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,

142361, u4162 ," Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4169 ,m278,,
142362, u4169 ," Counsel approach the bench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142363, u4162 ," Objection, Your Honor."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4169 ,m278,,
142364, u4169 ," You may call your next witness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142365, u4162 ," No questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142366, u4162 ," Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4169 ,m278,,
142367, u4169 ," Objection sustained.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4169 ,m278,,

142375, u4162 ," Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,
142376, u4166 ," Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
142377, u4162 ," Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4166 ,m278,,

142399, u4166 ," I was just about to make my point, Your Honor."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u4162 ,m278,,
