14477, u498 ," You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u494 ,m30,,

14484, u494 ," But it's romantic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14485, u498 ," That's because most of it never happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u494 ,m30,,
14486, u494 ," What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14487, u498 ," They met at Auburn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u494 ,m30,,

14503, u497 ," Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14504, u498 ," So you never bought any land.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,
14505, u497 ," I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,

14520, u497 ," I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14521, u498 ," True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,
14522, u497 ," Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14523, u498 ," Josephine and I have a lot in common.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,
14524, u497 ," No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14525, u498 ," Yes. But that's a different...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,

14528, u498 ," How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,
14529, u497 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,

14536, u498 ," How much time does he have left?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,
14537, u497 ," He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u498 ,m30,,
14538, u498 ," How is he?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u497 ,m30,,
