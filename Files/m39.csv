19420, u612 ," It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u623 ,m39,,

We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u623 ,m39,,
19441, u623 ," I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,

19446, u612 ," What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u623 ,m39,,
19447, u623 ," I want to know what happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,

19451, u612 ," To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u623 ,m39,,
19452, u623 ," I want to know about Treadstone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,
19453, u612 ," And what are we looking for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,
19454, u612 ," With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u623 ,m39,,
19455, u623 ," That's not gonna fly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,

19464, u627 ," Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,
19465, u612 ," Keep going...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u627 ,m39,,
19466, u627 ," Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,

19469, u612 ," It was staged?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u627 ,m39,,
19470, u627 ," There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,
19471, u612 ," And?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u627 ,m39,,
19472, u627 ," You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,
19473, u612 ," What do you have, Danny?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u627 ,m39,,
19474, u627 ," I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u627 ,m39,,
19475, u627 ," The sooner the better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u612 ,m39,,
