212282, u6267 ," Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212283, u6266 ," Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212284, u6266 ," If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212285, u6267 ," I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212286, u6266 ," Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212287, u6267 ," Let's get some coffee and talk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212288, u6266 ," Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212289, u6267 ," She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212290, u6266 ," You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212291, u6267 ," State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212292, u6266 ," Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212293, u6267 ," What would it take?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,

212295, u6267 ," If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212296, u6266 ," But if he knew we have so little time -,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212297, u6267 ," He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212298, u6266 ," He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212299, u6267 ," But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212300, u6266 ," Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212301, u6267 ," You seem pretty sure of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212302, u6266 ," Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212303, u6267 ," The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212304, u6266 ," I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212305, u6267 ," When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212306, u6267 ," Point taken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212307, u6266 ," It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212308, u6267 ," When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212309, u6267 ," They weren't there. Get close-ups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,

212311, u6266 ," Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212312, u6267 ," What do you see, Starling?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212313, u6266 ," He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212314, u6267 ," Are you finished?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212315, u6266 ," You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212316, u6267 ," What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212317, u6266 ," You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212318, u6267 ," Okay, Starling. Let's have it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,

212322, u6267 ," Why not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212323, u6266 ," What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212324, u6267 ," Why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,

212326, u6267 ," Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212327, u6267 ," Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,
212328, u6266 ," There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212329, u6267 ," Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
212330, u6267 ," You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,

Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6266 ,m419,,

It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u6267 ,m419,,
