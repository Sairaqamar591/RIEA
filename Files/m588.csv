292030, u8677 ," Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8675 ,m588,,

292032, u8677 ," Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8675 ,m588,,

And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8677 ,m588,,

292069, u8675 ," I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8677 ,m588,,
