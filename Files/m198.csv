101385, u3024 ," They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101386, u3031 ," Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,

101390, u3031 ," To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101391, u3031 ," I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,
101392, u3024 ," But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,

101396, u3024 ," As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101397, u3031 ," But the Romulans abandoned the plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,
101398, u3024 ," The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101399, u3031 ," Can you describe it, Deanna?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,

101413, u3024 ," It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101414, u3031 ," I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,
101415, u3024 ," About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101416, u3031 ," When was he... created?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,

101418, u3031 ," Please, Beverly, this is hard enough."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,
101419, u3024 ," Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3024 ,m198,,
101420, u3024 ," It'll serve you right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101421, u3031 ," I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole’ me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don’t show up for my physical on time!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101422, u3025 ," Sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,

101436, u3031 ," How can you be sure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101437, u3025 ," No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101438, u3031 ," He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101439, u3025 ," He would deny a """"human"""" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101440, u3031 ," But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101441, u3025 ," I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101442, u3031 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,

101447, u3031 ," Fire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101448, u3025 ," Ready, Captain."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101449, u3031 ," We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101450, u3025 ," Do you think this is a wise course of action?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101451, u3031 ," Well then... only one way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101452, u3025 ," Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101453, u3031 ," Can you open the shuttlebay doors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101454, u3025 ," Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101455, u3031 ," What do you imagine this is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101456, u3031 ," While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101457, u3025 ," They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,

101464, u3025 ," It would appear so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101465, u3031 ," A weapon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101466, u3025 ," Aye, sir... This way."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101467, u3031 ," A bit less florid, Data."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101468, u3025 ," He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,

101473, u3031 ," Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101474, u3025 ," Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101475, u3025 ," Sorry, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,

101490, u3025 ," That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
101491, u3031 ," Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101492, u3025 ," And this makes you """"sad""""?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,

101495, u3031 ," I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101496, u3025 ," Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3025 ,m198,,
101497, u3025 ," To happy endings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3031 ,m198,,
