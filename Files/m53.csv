25739, u832 ," If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25740, u824 ," Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,
25741, u832 ," She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25742, u824 ," Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,
25743, u832 ," Oh, yes."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25744, u824 ," I've always thought that myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,
25745, u832 ," They have noble faces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,
25746, u832 ," How lovely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25747, u824 ," And here is one of Frederick's mother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25748, u824 ," Oh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,
25749, u832 ," Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,

25753, u824 ," Mr. Merrick, sugar?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25754, u824 ," Oh Frederick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25755, u838 ," ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25756, u824 ," Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25757, u838 ," But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25758, u824 ," Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25759, u838 ," That I am very little different from him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25760, u824 ," Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25761, u838 ," Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25762, u824 ," ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25763, u838 ," Hmmm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25764, u824 ," More romances for John?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25765, u824 ," Dinner will be served, shortly, dear."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,

25770, u838 ," John loves the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25771, u838 ," I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25772, u824 ," Well, these things take time."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25773, u838 ," I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25774, u824 ," I'm sure I don't know, Freddie."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25775, u838 ," And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25776, u824 ," Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25777, u838 ," I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25778, u824 ," Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25779, u838 ," He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25780, u824 ," But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25781, u838 ," Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25782, u824 ," What do you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25783, u838 ," I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25784, u824 ," Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25785, u838 ," No, I think a whiskey."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25786, u824 ," Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25787, u838 ," Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25788, u824 ," Did it go well, darling?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25789, u838 ," I'll join you shortly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u824 ,m53,,
25790, u824 ," You won't be long?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25791, u838 ," I'll get my bag.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25792, u825 ," Like this. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25793, u838 ," What is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25794, u825 ," Our man is sick. Come right away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25795, u838 ," Did you see it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25796, u825 ," I found it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25797, u838 ," Yes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25798, u825 ," Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,

25800, u825 ," Don't!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25801, u826 ," I'll show you! I'll show you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25802, u825 ," What are you going to do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25803, u826 ," If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25804, u825 ," He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25805, u826 ," He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u825 ,m53,,
25806, u825 ," Aw, Bytes, he's sick."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25807, u826 ," You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25808, u826 ," Right... Right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25809, u838 ," Now I think we really do understand one another.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25810, u826 ," I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25811, u838 ," So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25812, u826 ," I want him back!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25813, u838 ," You don't own this man!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25814, u826 ," You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25815, u838 ," All you do is profit from another man's misery!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25816, u826 ," He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25817, u838 ," I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25818, u826 ," Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25819, u838 ," You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25820, u826 ," DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25821, u838 ," He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25822, u826 ," Never mind that, I want my man!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25823, u838 ," Just a moment, how did you get in here?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25824, u826 ," I want my man back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25825, u838 ," Everything will be seen to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25826, u826 ," I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25827, u838 ," You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his """"fall"""". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25828, u826 ," Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25829, u838 ," This man belongs in hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25830, u826 ," That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25831, u838 ," Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25832, u826 ," He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25833, u838 ," He must have taken quite a fall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25834, u826 ," He fell.  He falls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25835, u838 ," What happened?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25836, u838 ," I intend to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25837, u826 ," He was fine when he left here, and now look at him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25838, u838 ," What do you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u826 ,m53,,
25839, u826 ," What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25840, u827 ," Steady on, Treves. Have a seat."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25841, u838 ," Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25842, u838 ," Please do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25843, u827 ," Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25844, u838 ," But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25845, u827 ," Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25846, u838 ," Has the response picked up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25847, u827 ," Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25848, u838 ," No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25849, u827 ," Don't we?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25850, u827 ," Of course they will. They're reasonable men.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25851, u838 ," Do you think they'll go along with us?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25852, u827 ," Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25853, u838 ," Well, yes."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25854, u827 ," No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25855, u838 ," I could easily arrange...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25856, u827 ," You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25857, u827 ," No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25858, u838 ," Yes, I think I can."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25859, u827 ," Can you imagine what his life has been like?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25860, u838 ," Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25861, u827 ," Treves. Well done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25862, u838 ," Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25863, u827 ," I don't understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25864, u838 ," How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25865, u827 ," I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25866, u838 ," Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25867, u827 ," It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25868, u838 ," And what was that, John?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25869, u827 ," Oh yes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25870, u827 ," Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25871, u838 ," Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25872, u827 ," He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25873, u838 ," ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25874, u827 ," Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25875, u838 ," It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25876, u838 ," ...Yes, Sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25877, u827 ," Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25878, u838 ," Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25879, u827 ," Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25880, u838 ," Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25881, u827 ," Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25882, u827 ," Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25883, u838 ," Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25884, u827 ," No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say """"Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"""" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25885, u838 ," I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25886, u827 ," I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25887, u838 ," Well sir, perhaps I should explain..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25888, u827 ," A few words? I thought he was imbecile?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25889, u838 ," He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,
25890, u827 ," Good! How is the patient?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
25891, u838 ," Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u827 ,m53,,

A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u830 ,m53,,

25960, u831 ," It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick.

26101, u832 ," You did not ask me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26102, u838 ," Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,

I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say """"May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm."""" And you will say..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u832 ,m53,,

26150, u833 ," Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26151, u838 ," You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26152, u833 ," I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26153, u838 ," Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26154, u833 ," But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26155, u838 ," Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26156, u833 ," I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26157, u838 ," Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26158, u833 ," Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26159, u838 ," Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26160, u838 ," I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26161, u833 ," Watery headed bunch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26162, u838 ," I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26163, u833 ," Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26164, u838 ," We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26165, u833 ," Good Lord, Mr. Treves!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26166, u833 ," Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26167, u838 ," He's had his share of """"smacks"""", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26168, u833 ," Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26169, u838 ," No, he's very upset about something."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26170, u833 ," Won't come out, eh?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26171, u838 ," Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26172, u833 ," Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26173, u838 ," Yes! The workhouse!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26174, u833 ," The workhouse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26175, u838 ," Yes... Yes, let's go in."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26176, u833 ," Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26177, u838 ," Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26178, u833 ," I've heard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26179, u838 ," Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u833 ,m53,,
26180, u833 ," Fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26181, u838 ," Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26182, u838 ," YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u834 ,m53,,
26183, u834 ," YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26184, u838 ," YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u834 ,m53,,
26185, u834 ," When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26186, u838 ," HE'S GONE!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u834 ,m53,,
26187, u834 ," Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26188, u838 ," Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u834 ,m53,,
26189, u834 ," I... I don't know what you mean, Sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26190, u838 ," WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26191, u838 ," I'll send a cab. Here is my card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u836 ,m53,,
26192, u836 ," Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26193, u838 ," So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u836 ,m53,,
26194, u836 ," Never mind. I'm the owner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26195, u838 ," Pardon me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u836 ,m53,,
26196, u836 ," Handsomely?... Who sent you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26197, u838 ," I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u836 ,m53,,
26198, u836 ," I don't think so. No sir, we're closed."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
26199, u838 ," Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u836 ,m53,,
26200, u836 ," And who might you be, sir?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u838 ,m53,,
