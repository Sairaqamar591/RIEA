106840, u3162 ," Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106841, u3171 ," Look.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106842, u3162 ," Is anyone there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106843, u3162 ," Then go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106844, u3171 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106845, u3162 ," Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106846, u3171 ," It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106847, u3162 ," That's up to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106848, u3171 ," Do you think I should go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106849, u3171 ," It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106850, u3162 ," I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106851, u3171 ," He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106852, u3162 ," I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106853, u3171 ," And the second?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106854, u3162 ," Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106855, u3171 ," I did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106856, u3162 ," No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106857, u3171 ," I'm sorry. Forgive me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106858, u3162 ," You get straight to the point, don't you?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106859, u3171 ," Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106860, u3162 ," So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106861, u3171 ," I see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106862, u3162 ," I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106863, u3171 ," What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106864, u3162 ," She already has a daughter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106865, u3171 ," Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106866, u3162 ," No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106867, u3171 ," Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106868, u3162 ," Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106869, u3171 ," I don't understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106870, u3162 ," Afraid I'd give Mitch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106871, u3171 ," Afraid you'd take Mitch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106872, u3162 ," Because she was afraid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106873, u3171 ," Then why did she object to you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106874, u3162 ," Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106875, u3171 ," Then what was it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106876, u3162 ," Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106877, u3171 ," And what had you done?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106878, u3162 ," When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106879, u3162 ," Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106880, u3171 ," A trifle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106881, u3162 ," With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106882, u3171 ," Different?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106883, u3162 ," Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106884, u3171 ," When was this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106885, u3162 ," I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106886, u3171 ," What do you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106887, u3162 ," Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106888, u3171 ," Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106889, u3162 ," You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106890, u3171 ," I suspected as much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106891, u3162 ," I guess you knew that, anyway."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106892, u3162 ," Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106893, u3171 ," How'd you happen to come here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106894, u3162 ," San Francisco.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106895, u3171 ," Where are you from originally, Annie?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106896, u3162 ," Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106897, u3171 ," I despise it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106898, u3162 ," How do you like our little hamlet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106899, u3171 ," I think so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106900, u3162 ," Or would you rather I changed the subject?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106901, u3162 ," It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106902, u3171 ," Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106903, u3162 ," All right. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106904, u3171 ," No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106905, u3162 ," I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106906, u3171 ," If you have some, I'd..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106907, u3162 ," Would you like some brandy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106908, u3171 ," No, it's not the cut that's bothering me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106909, u3162 ," Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106910, u3171 ," Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106911, u3162 ," Miss Daniels? Is that you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106912, u3162 ," Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106913, u3171 ," I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106914, u3162 ," It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,
106915, u3162 ," Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3171 ,m208,,
106916, u3171 ," I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3162 ,m208,,

106968, u3168 ," He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3163 ,m208,,
