Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u114 ,m6,,

This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.

That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds.

3384, u114 ," You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,

Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,

3394, u114 ," It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,

3401, u110 ," Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,

3412, u110 ," It got to be too much for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u114 ,m6,,
3413, u114 ," Why do you think he did it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,
3414, u110 ," We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u114 ,m6,,

3419, u114 ," What was she running from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,
3420, u110 ," She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u114 ,m6,,
3421, u114 ," She just seemed... depressed... ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,
3422, u110 ," No.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u114 ,m6,,

3424, u114 ," You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u110 ,m6,,
