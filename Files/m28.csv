13123, u473 ," Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u454 ,m28,,
13124, u454 ," Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13125, u473 ," That is none of your business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u454 ,m28,,

13127, u473 ," Good morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u454 ,m28,,
13128, u454 ," Good day to you, young sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u463 ,m28,,
13129, u463 ," Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u455 ,m28,,
13130, u455 ," Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u463 ,m28,,
13131, u463 ," There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u463 ,m28,,
13132, u463 ," You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u455 ,m28,,
13133, u455 ," I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u463 ,m28,,
13134, u463 ," Both of us ride home with Best here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u463 ,m28,,
13135, u463 ," If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u455 ,m28,,
13136, u455 ," And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u455 ,m28,,
13137, u455 ," I never was more in earnest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u466 ,m28,,
13138, u466 ," Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u455 ,m28,,
13139, u455 ," It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u466 ,m28,,
13140, u466 ," Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u455 ,m28,,
13141, u455 ," I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u466 ,m28,,
13142, u466 ," Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13143, u456 ," Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13144, u473 ," And his baggage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13145, u456 ," You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13146, u473 ," Not yet, but I believe he intends to."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13147, u456 ," Has he sent the challenge yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13148, u473 ," I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13149, u456 ," What are the Chevalier's intentions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13150, u456 ," I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13151, u473 ," Only a very little, as soldiers do."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13152, u456 ," You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13153, u456 ," There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13154, u473 ," What is the service, sir?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13155, u456 ," Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13156, u473 ," The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13157, u473 ," How do you do, sir?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13158, u456 ," Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13159, u473 ," Neither!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13160, u456 ," It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13161, u473 ," Sir, I'm a British officer."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13162, u456 ," I have acted as I think fit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13163, u473 ," Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13164, u456 ," It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13165, u473 ," Where's the beauty you promised me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13166, u456 ," The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13167, u473 ," The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13168, u456 ," Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13169, u456 ," Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13170, u473 ," This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13171, u456 ," This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13172, u456 ," Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13173, u473 ," O'Grady.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u456 ,m28,,
13174, u456 ," What is your uncle's name?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13175, u473 ," My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13176, u457 ," He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13177, u473 ," The coward!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13178, u457 ," No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13179, u473 ," Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13180, u457 ," She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13181, u473 ," Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,

13185, u457 ," We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to """"Brown Bess."""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13186, u473 ," I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13187, u457 ," I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13188, u473 ," Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,

13190, u457 ," Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13191, u457 ," It must have been some other gate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13192, u473 ," Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13193, u457 ," But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,

13199, u473 ," It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13200, u457 ," That's a very handsome sword you have there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,

13205, u457 ," In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13206, u473 ," He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13207, u457 ," Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13208, u473 ," Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13209, u457 ," And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13210, u473 ," And so I am.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13211, u457 ," A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13212, u457 ," Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,

13214, u473 ," The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u457 ,m28,,
13215, u457 ," This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u458 ,m28,,
13216, u458 ," Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u473 ,m28,,
13217, u473 ," Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u458 ,m28,,

I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs.

No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.

When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u474 ,m28,,
