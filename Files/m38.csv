18679, u603 ," Where was I?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18680, u599 ," This morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18681, u603 ," When'd he tell you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18682, u599 ," That's a long time to be in jail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18683, u603 ," We said 48 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18684, u599 ," He went back for his brother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18685, u603 ," He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18686, u599 ," Maybe he just went to the store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18695, u603 ," Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18696, u599 ," This was in fourth grade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18702, u599 ," As long as he gets out OK.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18703, u603 ," Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18704, u599 ," No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18723, u599 ," I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18724, u603 ," Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18725, u599 ," No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18726, u603 ," Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18727, u599 ," Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18728, u603 ," True.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18729, u599 ," Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18730, u603 ," Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18731, u599 ," It's not a plan. It's just --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18732, u603 ," Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,

18746, u603 ," That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18747, u599 ," You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18748, u603 ," Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18750, u599 ," They obviously weren't designed for racing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18751, u603 ," What about them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18752, u599 ," Look at the treads on those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18754, u599 ," Dignan, those aren't running shoes."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18755, u603 ," See if mine are in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18756, u603 ," Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18757, u599 ," I keep it for emergencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18758, u603 ," Well, then cut it in half."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18759, u599 ," I don't want to use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18760, u603 ," She's not going to notice, Anthony."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18761, u599 ," Because my mom gets the bill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18777, u599 ," What about what that guy said?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18778, u603 ," We got it. We got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18779, u599 ," Holy shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18780, u603 ," Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18781, u599 ," Is that the manager?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,

18793, u599 ," Nothing. Go ahead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18794, u603 ," Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
18795, u603 ," That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,

18821, u599 ," Where are you going?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u599 ,m38,,
18822, u599 ," Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u603 ,m38,,
