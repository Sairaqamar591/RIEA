94022, u2767 ," And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the """"man"""" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94023, u2784 ," Of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2767 ,m181,,

94026, u2767 ," A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94058, u2784 ," No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,

94062, u2784 ," Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94063, u2768 ," -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94065, u2768 ," Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94069, u2768 ," Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94071, u2768 ," But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94072, u2784 ," No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94073, u2768 ," Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94075, u2768 ," That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94076, u2784 ," I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94077, u2768 ," This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94078, u2768 ," I want you back too, Viktor."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94080, u2768 ," -- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94081, u2784 ," I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94082, u2768 ," I just read somewhere --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94083, u2784 ," Impossible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,

94091, u2768 ," Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94092, u2784 ," Elaine, it's Wednesday."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,

94099, u2784 ," Excuse me?  Start?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94100, u2768 ," Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94101, u2784 ," I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,

94105, u2784 ," Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,
94106, u2768 ," Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,

94137, u2768 ," Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2784 ,m181,,
94138, u2784 ," You really think so?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,

94140, u2784 ," Better late than never.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2768 ,m181,,

94155, u2784 ," As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs.
