194145, u5677 ," Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,
194146, u5674 ," You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,
194147, u5674 ," You too, Diane."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,

194161, u5676 ," Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,
194162, u5674 ," What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,

194167, u5676 ," I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,
194168, u5674 ," Did you always know this was the life you wanted?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,

194178, u5676 ," I'd love to go there one time...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,
194179, u5674 ," But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,

194189, u5674 ," I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,
194190, u5676 ," Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,
194191, u5676 ," Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5674 ,m376,,
194192, u5674 ," She calls him Tommy...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,
194193, u5676 ," Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,

194196, u5674 ," It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,
194197, u5676 ," How's Peterson's holding up for you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5676 ,m376,,

194289, u5684 ," It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5678 ,m376,,

194296, u5684 ," I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5678 ,m376,,

194298, u5684 ," I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5684 ,m376,,
194299, u5684 ," Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5678 ,m376,,

194301, u5684 ," That must have been pretty special.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5678 ,m376,,
194302, u5678 ," We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5684 ,m376,,
194303, u5684 ," Where did you get Pilgrim from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5684 ,m376,,
194304, u5684 ," Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5678 ,m376,,
