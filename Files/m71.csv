As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u1087 ,m71,,

The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u1089 ,m71,,
