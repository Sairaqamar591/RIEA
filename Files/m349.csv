If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5273 ,m349,,

181959, u5273 ," If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5281 ,m349,,

181962, u5281 ," That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5273 ,m349,,
181963, u5273 ," Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5281 ,m349,,

181989, u5273 ," A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5273 ,m349,,
181990, u5273 ," That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5276 ,m349,,
