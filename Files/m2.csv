1138, u44 ," Who's there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u29 ,m2,,
1139, u29 ," You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u34 ,m2,,

But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u34 ,m2,,
1142, u34 ," But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u29 ,m2,,

1145, u29 ," No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u34 ,m2,,
