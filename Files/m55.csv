26827, u859 ," Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u859 ,m55,,

26832, u859 ," Okay, I guess."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u863 ,m55,,

26840, u861 ," I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u859 ,m55,,
26841, u859 ," Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u861 ,m55,,
26842, u861 ," Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u859 ,m55,,
26843, u859 ," Doesn't sound like me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u861 ,m55,,

26851, u859 ," Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u861 ,m55,,
26852, u861 ," I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u859 ,m55,,
26853, u859 ," Well, you obviously don't know me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u861 ,m55,,
26854, u861 ," Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u859 ,m55,,

26882, u861 ," I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, """"so go"""" with such disdain."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u859 ,m55,,
