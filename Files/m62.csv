30468, u955 ," Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u955 ,m62,,

30489, u955 ," Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u956 ,m62,,

30496, u955 ," Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u956 ,m62,,
30497, u956 ," So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u955 ,m62,,
