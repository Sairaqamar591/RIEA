189743, u5545 ," I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189744, u5540 ," I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,

189747, u5545 ," I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,

189751, u5545 ," I want it met.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189752, u5540 ," That plane goes to Miami...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,

189758, u5545 ," Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189759, u5540 ," He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189760, u5540 ," Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189761, u5545 ," How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,

189768, u5540 ," Mike, at three and a half..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189769, u5545 ," Was it a boy or a girl?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189770, u5540 ," Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189771, u5545 ," Go on, tell me."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,

189776, u5545 ," I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189777, u5540 ," The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189778, u5545 ," I asked about Fredo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189779, u5540 ," Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,

189784, u5545 ," Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,
189785, u5540 ," No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189786, u5545 ," Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189787, u5545 ," If I'm wrong...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,

189789, u5545 ," I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,

189791, u5545 ," I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189792, u5545 ," No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,

189796, u5545 ," There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,
189797, u5545 ," Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5540 ,m369,,

That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo.

We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u5545 ,m369,,

Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.

Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.
