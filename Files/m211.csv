108277, u3197 ," What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108278, u3197 ," What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3202 ,m211,,

108282, u3204 ," Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108283, u3197 ," Maybe a little demonstration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108284, u3204 ," Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,

108286, u3204 ," That can easily be arranged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108287, u3197 ," Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108288, u3204 ," Yes -- of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,

108291, u3197 ," The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108292, u3204 ," I assure you such power exists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108293, u3197 ," Such power exists?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108294, u3204 ," I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108295, u3197 ," One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108296, u3204 ," I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108297, u3197 ," I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108298, u3204 ," My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108299, u3197 ," What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108300, u3204 ," No -- not at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108301, u3197 ," You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108302, u3204 ," I leave that in your hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108303, u3197 ," It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108304, u3204 ," That's what I came to see you about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108305, u3197 ," Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108306, u3204 ," Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108307, u3197 ," What -- what sort of action do you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108308, u3204 ," I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108309, u3197 ," I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108310, u3204 ," What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108311, u3197 ," Would you care to be more specific?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108312, u3204 ," I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108313, u3197 ," We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108314, u3204 ," We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108315, u3197 ," These other planets -- do they have peace and security?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108316, u3204 ," We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108317, u3197 ," If you mean that you are afraid of us--,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108318, u3204 ," In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108319, u3197 ," Yes -- that is true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108320, u3204 ," It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108321, u3197 ," That was my first question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108322, u3204 ," I would like to explain something of my mission here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108323, u3197 ," It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108324, u3204 ," You have faith, Professor Barnhardt"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108325, u3204 ," My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108326, u3197 ," As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108327, u3204 ," I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108328, u3197 ," How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108329, u3204 ," Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108330, u3197 ," Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108331, u3197 ," Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3204 ,m211,,
108332, u3204 ," It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3197 ,m211,,
108333, u3197 ," You wrote this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108334, u3198 ," Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108335, u3201 ," Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108336, u3198 ," Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108337, u3201 ," Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108338, u3198 ," Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108339, u3198 ," Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108340, u3201 ," He gave these to you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108341, u3201 ," You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108342, u3198 ," Yes, I have!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108343, u3201 ," Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108344, u3198 ," No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108345, u3201 ," Bobby, you've been dreaming again."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108346, u3198 ," Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108347, u3201 ," Now, Bobby, just a minute--"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108348, u3198 ," I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108349, u3201 ," Tell me what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108350, u3198 ," I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108351, u3201 ," Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108352, u3201 ," No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108353, u3198 ," I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108354, u3201 ," What do you mean, dear?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,

108356, u3198 ," Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108357, u3201 ," Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
108358, u3198 ," Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3201 ,m211,,
108359, u3201 ," Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3198 ,m211,,
