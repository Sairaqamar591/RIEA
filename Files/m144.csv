74888, u2224 ," I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2229 ,m144,,
74889, u2229 ," Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74890, u2224 ," My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2229 ,m144,,
74891, u2229 ," I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74892, u2224 ," It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2229 ,m144,,
74893, u2229 ," I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74894, u2224 ," My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2229 ,m144,,
74895, u2229 ," But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74896, u2224 ," It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74897, u2236 ," I am at your disposal, Your Majesty."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74898, u2224 ," General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74899, u2236 ," If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74900, u2236 ," I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74901, u2224 ," What do you think Napoleon will do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74902, u2236 ," If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74903, u2224 ," Proceed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74904, u2236 ," Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74905, u2224 ," I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74906, u2236 ," Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74907, u2224 ," Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74908, u2236 ," I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74909, u2224 ," Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74910, u2236 ," The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74911, u2224 ," Ah, yes -- proceed."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74912, u2236 ," Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74913, u2224 ," I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74914, u2236 ," You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74915, u2224 ," Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74916, u2236 ," Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74917, u2224 ," For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74918, u2236 ," The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74919, u2224 ," Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74920, u2236 ," I have heard that story but I do not believe it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74921, u2224 ," You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74922, u2236 ," But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74923, u2224 ," Proceed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74924, u2236 ," I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74925, u2224 ," General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74926, u2236 ," If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74927, u2224 ," I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74928, u2236 ," Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74929, u2224 ," Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2236 ,m144,,
74930, u2236 ," I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74931, u2224 ," I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2244 ,m144,,
74932, u2244 ," What do you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74933, u2224 ," Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2244 ,m144,,
74934, u2244 ," Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. """"Berthier sees only what is in the open,"""" Murat said.  """"But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""""  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2224 ,m144,,
74935, u2224 ," Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u2244 ,m144,,
74936, u2244 ," You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.
