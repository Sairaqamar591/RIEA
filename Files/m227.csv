116391, u3451 ," Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116392, u3443 ," You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3451 ,m227,,
116393, u3451 ," Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,

116396, u3443 ," Captured?  How?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3451 ,m227,,
116397, u3451 ," It can be captured, sometimes."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116398, u3443 ," Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3451 ,m227,,
116399, u3451 ," I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116400, u3443 ," This is still a script we're talking about, right?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3451 ,m227,,

116402, u3443 ," What's that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3451 ,m227,,
116403, u3451 ," I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3445 ,m227,,
116404, u3445 ," Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116405, u3443 ," Robert?  I...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3445 ,m227,,
116406, u3445 ," And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116407, u3443 ," Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116408, u3443 ," My child?  No...but...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3445 ,m227,,
116409, u3445 ," Do you let your child watch your movies?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116410, u3443 ," No, not really.  I..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3445 ,m227,,
116411, u3445 ," Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116412, u3443 ," I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3450 ,m227,,

116415, u3450 ," Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116416, u3443 ," Coffee'd be nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3450 ,m227,,
116417, u3450 ," Can I get you something to drink?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3450 ,m227,,
116418, u3450 ," Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116419, u3443 ," Now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3450 ,m227,,
116420, u3450 ," No time like the present.  The car will bring you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
116421, u3443 ," Uh...sure...when?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3450 ,m227,,
116422, u3450 ," Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u3443 ,m227,,
