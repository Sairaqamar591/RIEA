295014, u8764 ," I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8758 ,m594,,
295015, u8758 ," No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8764 ,m594,,
295016, u8764 ," He won't talk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8758 ,m594,,

295019, u8759 ," No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,
295020, u8767 ," I -- I --,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295021, u8759 ," He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,

295030, u8759 ," But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,
295031, u8767 ," Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295032, u8759 ," Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,
295033, u8767 ," Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295034, u8759 ," Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,

295042, u8759 ," All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,

295050, u8759 ," Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,
295051, u8767 ," Have you talked to the doctors at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,

295053, u8767 ," Well?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295054, u8759 ," Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,

295057, u8767 ," How often does this happen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295058, u8759 ," I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why..."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,

295063, u8767 ," I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295064, u8759 ," If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,

295072, u8767 ," No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the """"old college gang""""; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,

295074, u8767 ," No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,

295083, u8767 ," How long have you been back?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8759 ,m594,,
295084, u8759 ," No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,", u8767 ,m594,,
